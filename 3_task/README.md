### This code performs the following steps:

1. It loads the training and test datasets from CSV files into pandas data frames.

2. It separates the target variable from the training data and assigns it to y_train. The remaining columns of the training data are assigned to X_train.

3. It preprocesses the data using the ColumnTransformer class from sklearn. It scales the numerical features using StandardScaler and one-hot encodes the categorical features using OneHotEncoder. The preprocessed data is assigned to X_train_preprocessed.

4. It splits the preprocessed training data into training and validation sets using train_test_split from sklearn. 80% of the data is assigned to the training set and 20% to the validation set.

5. It defines a linear regression model using the LinearRegression class from sklearn and creates a pipeline to apply the preprocessing steps and the model.

6. It fits the pipeline to the training data.

7. It evaluates the performance of the model on the validation set using mean squared error (MSE) and prints the root mean squared error (RMSE).

8. It uses the trained model to predict the target variable for the test data and saves the predictions to a CSV file named 'internship_predictions.csv'.
