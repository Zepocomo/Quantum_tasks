### [Task #2](https://github.com/Zepocomo/Quantum_tasks/tree/main/2_task "2_task")
#### Counting islands?
#### **condition of the problem ↓**
##### You have a matrix MxN that represents a map. There are 2 possible states on the map: 1 - islands, 0 - ocean. Your task is to calculate the number of islands in the most effective way. Please write code in Python 3.

### [Task #3](https://github.com/Zepocomo/Quantum_tasks/tree/main/4_task "4_task")
#### 4.	Soil erosion detection
#### **condition of the problem ↓**
##### You have a dataset (internship_train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target column. Your task is to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features. Please provide predictions for internship_hidden_test.csv file. Target metric is RMSE

### [Task #4](https://github.com/Zepocomo/Quantum_tasks/tree/main/3_task "3_task")
#### Regression on the tabular data
#### **condition of the problem ↓**
##### Here is one of the open problems in Quantum. Soil erosion is a really unwanted process that spoils huge areas of fertile land. Your task is to train model for erosion detection.
